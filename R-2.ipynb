    "So far, we've only looked at data from 2015. However, part of what makes the LODES data so useful is the availability of the data over many years. The data are available in multiple CSV files. There are many insights we might find from analyzing data over years, so we want to be able to bring them all together. In this notebook, we'll explore how to do that as we try to answer the following questions:\n",

Here, we'll walk through creating your own function.
